-Creating an open-source dataset with my final clean data and a benchmark for prediction <br/>
<br/>
Plan of action:<br/>
-Cleaning data<br/>
-Trying a bunch of unsupervised learning algorithms:<br/>
  *Writing simple models that get more complicated later on<br/>
  *Unhazing images and comparing results<br/>
<br/>
-Labeling data<br/>
