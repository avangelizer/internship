# internship
Repository containing my notebooks and scripts for my internship at IRD.
I will be updating this file regularly. 

Objective of the project: 
-Classifying underwater images into corals or algae.
-Creating an open-source dataset with my final clean data and a benchmark for prediction 

Plan of action:
-Cleaning data
-Trying a bunch of unsupervised learning algorithms:
  *Writing simple models that get more complicated later on
  *Unhazing images and comparing results

-Labeling data
-Trying a bunch of supervised learning algorithms
  *Writing simple models that get more complicated later on*
  *Unhazing images and comparing results*
-Writing report
